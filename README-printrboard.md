## Fork: MarginallyClever + hardware config

This is a fork of a fork: <https://github.com/MarginallyClever/Marlin-polargraph> is a fork (thank you!) of [Marlin](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin) for a hanging V plotter robot like the Marginally Clever Robotics Makelangelo at <https://www.marginallyclever.com/> or Sandy Noble's Polargraph at <https://www.polargraph.co.uk/>. 

This personal fork is to keep track of the configuration for my machine, which is built with a printrboard Rev. D board: <https://reprap.org/wiki/Printrboard>.
